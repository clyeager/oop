#What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby?

#Allowing for encapsulation, which helps in organization
#Allows organization and grouping in a logical manner
#Allows us to scope at different levels, which in turn allows easier debugging by 
  #keeping erros in certain scope
##Allows us to think about a problem on a high level of abstraction so we can 
  #design an appropriate outline before implementation details
#Allows us to reuse code through inheritance and polymorphism
#Keeps code DRY
#Easier management of complexity
